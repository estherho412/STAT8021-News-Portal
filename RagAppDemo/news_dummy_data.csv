Justice Department reaches $139 million settlement over FBI failures in investigation of Nassar gymnastics abuse claims,"The Justice Department has reached a $138.7 million settlement with more than 100 victims of disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar over the FBI’s initial failures in investigating the sexual assault case.

More than 150 women and girls, including Olympic athletes, have alleged that Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of performing medical treatments. The FBI failed to investigate their claims, the victims say.

Nassar, who was convicted of sexually abusing young athletes under the guise of medical treatment, was sentenced in a Michigan state court to up to 175 years in prison.

“For decades, Lawrence Nassar abused his position, betraying the trust of those under his care and medical supervision while skirting accountability,” Benjamin Mizer, the acting associate attorney general, said in a statement Tueday. “These allegations should have been taken seriously from the outset. While these settlements won’t undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the critical support they need to continue healing.”

The Justice Department acknowledged its failures in a scathing inspector general’s report that found senior officials in the FBI Indianapolis field office failed to respond to the Nassar allegations, made numerous and fundamental errors when they did respond and violated multiple FBI policies when undertaking their investigative activity.

In 2021, victims of Nassar reached a $380 million settlement with USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and their insurers. In 2022, the DOJ offered to begin settlement discussions with the sexual assault survivors.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/politics/usa-gymnastics-fbi-larry-nassar-settlement/index.html
Documents found on a North Korean server suggest US studios may have unknowingly outsourced animation work,"North Korean illustrators and graphic designers appear to have helped produce work for US animation studios unbeknownst to those companies, suggesting that unreleased episodes of a few popular American cartoons could include work from one of the most closed-off economies in the world.

The revelation comes from a trove of documents recently discovered by US researchers inside a computer server housed in North Korea. It’s unclear how the files ended up in this tightly controlled portion of the internet, but the researchers who analyzed them told CNN they appear to be the result of work that was unknowingly outsourced to North Korean workers.

The US has imposed strict sanctions prohibiting American companies from doing business with the nuclear-armed regime.

In addition to drawings for an upcoming season of the Amazon Prime Video show “Invincible,” the files also contain sketches and videos that resemble work for “Iyanu: Child of Wonder,” a superhero series slated to air on Max, the streaming service that, along with CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.

There is no evidence that the studios had any knowledge their proprietary work was on a North Korean server.

The files were discovered in December by Nick Roy, a Boston-based cyber-sleuth who regularly scans the North Korean internet as a hobby. Roy found a new North Korean website that outside visitors didn’t need a password to access, unlocking a trove of animation sketches, and shared them with the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank.  
The documents include a series of Chinese instructions that have been translated into Korean. They call for making adjustments to the size and style of the animation. Among the documents, there is also an editing sheet written in English with specifications for animation work with “Invincible” printed atop.

The discovery raises questions about the ability of US tech and creative arts companies to control their supply chains and avoid work that could inadvertently violate sanctions banning countries from doing business with North Korea.

They also offer a rare window into how graphic designers operate in one of the world’s most closed countries. A 2022 public advisory warning from the FBI and departments of State and Treasury mentions animation as one of many sectors where North Korean IT workers ply their trade. US officials are particularly concerned that North Korean workers are posing as other nationalities to get hired at US companies.

Logs from the North Korean computer server showed multiple visits from internet connections in northeast China, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant told CNN. Both Roy and Michael Barnhart, a North Korea specialist at Mandiant, told CNN that those log files suggest workers in China may have been passing along instructions to their North Korean counterparts on the animation projects.
Other computers from within North Korea also appear to have been connecting to the computer server, Roy said, suggesting there were people accessing the animation files not only in China but also in North Korea.
In a statement to CNN, California-based Skybound Entertainment, which produces “Invincible” for Amazon, said it does not contract with Chinese or North Korean companies and has no knowledge of such companies working on “Invincible.” Skybound Entertainment said it would investigate the research that CNN presented.

“Our contracts specifically prohibit outsourcing to any third-party without our express prior written consent, and no such consent has been sought nor granted,” Skybound Entertainment spokesperson Hannah Cosgrove said. Skybound Entertainment is “taking this matter very seriously” and has “started an investigation to get to the bottom of this with third party counsel,” Cosgrove added.

Max declined to comment. Maryland-based YouNeek Studios, which co-created the “Iyanu” graphic novel series that the animated show is based on, did not respond to requests for comment. US-based Lion Forge Entertainment, which is producing the “Iyanu” animated show, declined to comment.

A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Lion Forge Entertainment contracted with a South Korea-based animation studio for the work. But late last year, the source said, Lion Forge discovered that the South Korean studio had further outsourced animation work for Iyanu to other South Korean companies without authorization. Lion Forge severed ties with the South Korean animation studio in January, the source said.

The South Korean studio told Lion Forge that it had outsourced the work only to South Korean companies, not any entity in North Korea, the source added.
Animation as a source of revenue
After discovering the files, Roy shared them with his friend Martyn Williams, a North Korea expert and senior fellow at the Stimson Center, which analyzed the files. Williams and his colleagues concluded that they looked like part of a work order.

“It looks very much like this is all working-level editing files for these animations,” Williams said.

“The North Koreans have a lot of software companies set up in China that act as kind of fronts and will send information, send work back to Pyongyang, where the work is done,” Williams told CNN.

The think tank found no evidence to suggest the American companies were aware of the activity, he added. Because the editing comments on the files were written in Chinese, “it is likely that the contracting arrangement was several steps downstream from the major producers,” the Stimson Center’s 38 North project, which focuses on North Korea, says in a report published Monday.

The North Korean regime has long been enamored with movie studios and animation as a vehicle for propaganda and a source of revenue, according to experts. North Korea was more advanced in animation than South Korea for several years after the Korean Peninsula was split following World War II.

North Korea’s main animation studio is Pyongyang-based SEK Studio, which was founded in the 1950s and has contracted with a range of foreign companies over the years. The US Treasury Department sanctioned SEK Studio in 2021 for being connected to the North Korean regime.

“Seemingly fueled by the desire for unreasonably low-cost labor, foreign media companies continue to subcontract animation work to SEK Studio,” the Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the sanctions. The studio uses “animation workers” in North Korea and China, the department said.

Williams suspects SEK Studio may be involved in the animation work discovered on the computer server because SEK is the only entity in North Korea capable of handling this kind of volume.
Battered by sanctions and strapped for cash, the North Korean regime has turned to thousands of IT workers living abroad to bring in hard currency, according to US officials and private experts.

Since the 2022 advisory, FBI agents and State and Treasury officials have been quietly trying to raise awareness of the North Korean insider threat by conducting briefings for business executives and chasing down leads about potential North Korean IT workers at US companies.

Barnhart, the Mandiant researcher, said any company that hires a North Korean IT worker runs the risk of being targeted by North Korean hackers because of the close relationship between the two.

“There are a lot more overlaps that we’re beginning to see with these IT workers and [North Korean hackers],” Barnhart told CNN.

A previous CNN investigation found that the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.
As for the recently discovered North Korean server, Mandiant made a report of its findings — that the server appeared to be hosting content from US animation studios — available to government agencies, including the FBI, Barnhart said.

The FBI declined to comment.

CNN has requested comment from North Korea’s observer mission to the United Nations in New York and the North Korean Embassy in London.

A Treasury Department spokesperson told CNN the department does not comment on potential or hypothetical sanctions violations.

“Treasury remains concerned about North Korean efforts to generate revenue for their weapons programs, including through cybercrime and the abuse of contractors, and urges industry to be vigilant against any attempts to evade sanctions,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

Scouring North Korea’s internet
Roy, the independent researcher, has been scanning North Korean internet infrastructure for nearly a decade from his studio in Boston and elsewhere. He does it, he says, to help close the “gap in information” that outsiders have about the East Asian country.

The North Korean internet has just over 1,000 IP addresses, the unique identifiers that allow a computer to connect to the public internet, according to Roy. The US has over 1.5 billion IP addresses.

The sketches reviewed by CNN wouldn’t look out of place at a big animation studio anywhere in the world. There are superheroes with sharp jaw lines and muscular features, and cape-wearing anime-style figures with tousled hair and darting eyes.

Heinz Insu Fenkl, an expert in North Korean comics, said that animation and comics have been prominent in North Korean society since the country’s founding in 1948.

Today, North Korean comics are sold in street markets in northeast China and bring in precious revenue for the regime, he added.

“Because North Korea does so much of the groundwork of animation, they have the technology,” Fenkl said. “They spend a lot of energy and money keeping their technology updated in those areas.”

But recent advancements in animation in North Korea have also come in part by simply ripping off Western production companies, according to Fenkl.

“That’s why you can probably see things like production sketches while an animation project is going on because there may well be [someone] who is not known to be a North Korean working at that studio,” he told CNN.

North Korea claims it tested new command-and-control system in simulated nuclear counterstrike,"Seoul, South Korea
CNN
 — 
North Korea claims it tested a new nuclear weapons command-and-control system Monday, with the firing of projectiles carrying simulated nuclear warheads from multiple rocket launcher units.

Leader Kim Jong Un directed the drill, which simulated a nuclear counterattack, according to a report from the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), following what it claimed were “extremely provocative and aggressive” annual joint air force exercises conducted by the United States and South Korea.

North Korea has tested both the rocket launcher system and a simulated nuclear counterstrike before, according to analysts, but KCNA said Monday’s exercise was the first time the “Haekbangashoe” – or nuclear trigger – command-and-control system was used, demonstrating what it claimed was an ability to switch rocket launchers from conventional to nuclear weapons.

“They are thinking about command and control. These are the practical questions about how an order should be transmitted from Kim, down the chain of command, and to launch units,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an analyst at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.

Joseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the nuclear counterstrike drill showed “a desire to portray wider credibility and capability in nuclear forces proficiency and posture beyond simply demonstrating just missile delivery systems.”
But he said it was hard to determine if Monday’s exercise showed anything new.
“How mature this command-and-control system already is, or will become, remains very difficult to assess,” Dempsey added.

Since conducting its first nuclear test more than a decade ago, North Korea has advanced its weapons capabilities, with the ambition of miniaturizing a warhead so that it can fit on a long-range missile.

Kim ramped up those efforts in 2022, vowing to develop nuclear arms at the “highest possible” speed, passing a new law that declared North Korea a nuclear weapons state, and saying there could be no negotiations on denuclearization.

Though the regime’s true capabilities have not been independently verified, a 2017 report from the US Defense Intelligence Agency concluded North Korea had likely achieved its key goal of miniaturization.

Experts say North Korea has likely already manufactured a small stockpile of nuclear warheads – but it remains unproven whether it has been able to make them small and light enough to be fitted on a missile.

Images supplied by North Korea Monday showed four rockets being launched, with KCNA saying they hit targets on an island 352 kilometers (218 miles) away.
On Monday, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North had fired multiple short-range missiles into the waters off the peninsula’s east coast.

Kim said the exercise helped prepare North Korea’s nuclear forces for “their important mission of deterring a war and taking the initiative in a war,” according to the KCNA report.

The Kim regime has tested a series of weapons in recent months, including long-range artillery that has the South Korean capital of Seoul within its range, a hypersonic glide vehicle, which in theory could carry a warhead past South Korean and US air defenses, and an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the US mainland.

Meanwhile, Seoul and Washington have held frequent military exercises of their own, the latest being the two-week Korea Flying Training 2024, which began on April 12.
It has so far featured about 100 warplanes from the two allies, including F-35 stealth fighters from both.

The US-South Korea exercise has “incited extreme war fever” and cannot be classified as defense or deterrence, the KCNA report said.

A US Air Force news release called it a critical training event to “protect and defend the U.S., allies, and partner interests at a moment’s notice.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/asia/north-korea-simulated-nuclear-counterstrike-intl-hnk-ml/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc
"After Tesla’s falling sales, layoffs and other problems, this is a crucial earnings report","New York
CNN
 — 
Tesla is having a very bad year so far. Investors will get an idea of just how bad after the company reports earnings and offers comments to investors after the bell today.

So far this year Tesla shares have fallen 43% as of the close of trading Monday, after losing another 3% on the day following the latest round of price cuts announced over the weekend.

The drop in the value of the stock has even some Tesla bulls worried about the future for the world’s most valuable automaker, and one that had been among the most profitable for the last five years. Concerns about the EV demand not living up to forecasts is hurting all auto stocks, but Tesla has had its own run of bad news lately to worry investors. And it makes what Tesla says Tuesday evening very important for its future.
“The moment of truth has now arrived for Elon Musk and Tesla,” said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities who has had a bullish view of Tesla for years. But he said the “conference call and messaging one of the most important moments in the company’s history.”

“For the first time many long time Tesla believers are giving up on the story and throwing in the white towel,” he wrote. “The miscalculation of demand erosion in China has been a gut punch to the bull thesis. The global EV landscape has turned Tesla from a Cinderella story to a horror show in the near-term.”

The latest price cuts announcement, which reduced the US prices of the Model Y, Model X and Model S by $2,000 each, while leaving prices unchanged for the Model 3 and the Cybertruck, follows its first year-over-year decline in global sales since the pandemic. Tesla has said it plans to cut more than 10% of its staff. The company also said it seeking approval from shareholders to restore stock options to allow CEO Elon Musk to buy 300 million shares of its stock at a discount after a Delaware judge earlier this year threw out the 2018 compensation package that had included those options.
The company is clearly facing the greatest competitive challenge since it became profitable in 2019. Not only is it facing more competition from traditional western automakers who are rolling out their own EV models, but it’s also facing increased competition from Chinese automakers.

An EV battle with China
In the final three months of last year Tesla lost its title as the world’s largest EV maker to Chinese automaker BYD.

And although it reclaimed the title in the first quarter, its first quarter sales were much weaker than expected, adding to concerns that projections of strong growth for EVs were greatly overplayed.

Ives is very concerned about what the unpredictable Musk might tell investors during the call on Tuesday.

“If Musk is flippant again and there is no adult in the room on this conference call with no answers then darker days are ahead,” he wrote.
Despite Tesla’s drop in sales and price cutting, it is still the most valuable automaker in the world, with a market cap of $469 billion, roughly $100 billion more than No. 2 Toyota and nearly five times as much as General Motors and Ford, combined.

But it’s lost more than half of its value from when it was a $1 trillion stock, and some Tesla bears argue it is still grossly over-valued. The company shares hit an all time high in November of 2021, after a very strong year, then lost nearly two-thirds of their value in 2022, before doubling once again in 2023 ahead of 2024’s current slide.

Analyst Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research says that the latest price cut will end up costing Tesla at least $1 billion and should have shaved an additional 10% off the stock than the drop that occurred in trading Monday.

“It is our strong opinion that the full extent of this weekend’s ‘nightmarish’ price cuts are not being fully appreciated by Mr. Market,” he wrote Monday.

Analysts are forecasting Tesla to report adjusted earnings of 49 cents a share, sharply lower than the 85 cents a share it reported a year ago. Its profit margins, also a closely watched number, have been falling steadily since it started an EV price war more than a year ago.

But much of the focus Tuesday will be on its guidance for future plans, specifically a lower-priced version of its car, to be called the Model 2, and its plans for a fleet of driverless “robotaxis,” that it said it would unveil in August.

After Reuters reported earlier this month that it was dropping plans for the Model 2 because of competition from China, Musk tweeted “Reuters is lying (again),” without giving any details of the company’s plans. But in January, he did warn that Chinese automakers could ‘demolish’ rivals with low priced EVs. What he says about the competition from Chinese EVs today will also be a key focus for investors.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/business/tesla-report-earnings-result/index.html
TikTok could face EU fines and a suspension over sister app TikTok Lite,"European officials are threatening TikTok with massive fines and a possible forced suspension this week of parts of a new spinoff app, launched this month, that regulators allege contains addictive features.

The warnings target TikTok Lite, a less data-intensive version of TikTok’s main app which contains a feature that rewards users with cash for engaging with TikTok content and app features.

EU officials fear the feature could be used to turn TikTok Lite users into addicts who can’t stop using the app and described it as an “experiment” on unwitting EU citizens in Spain and France where TikTok Lite has been made available.

Monday’s announcement by the European Union marks the trading bloc’s second major inquiry into TikTok and focuses specifically on TikTok Lite and what officials said were risks of serious harms to users’ mental health.

The move comes days after the US House of Representatives passed legislation that could ultimately ban TikTok from the United States over national security concerns. The US Senate is expected to take up that measure as early as this week, as part of a vote on foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine.

The latest EU probe represents the first time Commission officials have flexed their power using certain new tools granted to them under Europe’s far-reaching new law regulating online platforms, the Digital Services Act (DSA).
“This is a demonstration of the fact that when we say minor protection is a priority under the DSA, we really mean it,” a European Commission official told reporters Monday.
“We are disappointed with this decision,” a TikTok spokesperson said in response to the EU warnings. “The TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks. We will continue discussions with the Commission.”

The European Commission said Monday it had given TikTok 48 hours to defend its reward program to officials, after which TikTok could be ordered to suspend the rewards feature in TikTok Lite as an urgent temporary measure. A decision to order the suspension could come as early as Thursday, commission officials told reporters on a conference call. A suspension could last 60 days and be repeatedly renewed.

In addition, TikTok could be fined for failing to provide information it owes to the Commission about TikTok Lite, including a risk assessment report and a separate report outlining steps the company has taken to minimize those risks. EU officials first sent their request for information last week. It is separate from another ongoing DSA investigation into TikTok, launched in February, over the company’s approach to user harms more generally.

Failure to hand over the TikTok Lite risk assessment by Tuesday, and the risk mitigation report by May 3, could result in fines of up to 1% of TikTok’s global annual revenue and “periodic penalties” of up to 5% of TikTok’s average daily revenue, the Commission said.
TikTok could face further, additional fines of up to 6% of its global annual revenue if the TikTok Lite features the Commission is investigating are determined to be violations of the DSA.

Both the possible forced suspension and the potential fines are procedural tools the European Commission has not used before under the DSA, a commission official said.

“So far this has never been necessary, because in all our 40-plus requests for information that have been sent, companies have always supplied the information,” the official told reporters on the call. “Generally speaking, we’ve never not received the reply to our request for information.”

Commission officials repeatedly declined to say whether TikTok had offered an explanation for why it did not submit the requested information.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/tech/tiktok-lite-eu-investigation/index.html
TikTok vows legal challenge to potential US app ban,"TikTok will file a court challenge if Congress passes legislation paving the way to a nationwide ban of the app, a top executive told employees in an internal memo obtained by CNN.

On Saturday the House of Representatives passed a foreign aid package containing language that could lead to a ban of TikTok — and the bill could pass the Senate within days, Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s head of public policy for the Americas, warned employees in the memo he sent the same day.

“At the stage that the bill is signed [by President Joe Biden], we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,” Beckerman wrote to staff, describing the legislation as “an unprecedented deal worked out between the Republican Speaker [Mike Johnson] and President Biden.”

“This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,” Beckerman added. He invited employees to an internal town hall scheduled for Wednesday “for additional context.”

The memo was earlier reported by The Information. A TikTok spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The legislation calls for forcing TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app within 270 days — otherwise it would be illegal for US app stores to offer TikTok for downloads. The legislation also would allow Biden to extend that deadline by another 90 days if he determines there’s been progress toward a sale.
Foreshadowing its legal strategy, TikTok has already publicly opposed the bill as an infringement on its users’ First Amendment rights. Supporters of the legislation, by contrast, have said it is a necessary measure to protect Americans’ personal data and have pushed back on characterizations of it as a flat-out ban.

Some legal experts on the First Amendment have suggested TikTok could have a case, noting that courts have tended to look at the ultimate impacts of challenged laws on Americans’ speech and not just their stated intent.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/tech/tiktok-vows-legal-challenge-to-potential-us-app-ban/index.html
Elon Musk Opposes TikTok Ban As New Restrictions Gain Steam In Congress,"Billionaire X owner Elon Musk said Friday he opposes banning TikTok, as a bill that would either force the app’s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok or prohibit its operation in the U.S. is expected to pass the House Saturday, part of the hotly debated bipartisan foreign aid package.
KEY FACTS
Musk tweeted his opposition to a TikTok ban Friday, calling it “contrary to freedom of speech and expression,” adding he is against the proposed TikTok controls “even though such a ban may benefit the X platform.”

The statement came hours after the House cleared a procedural hurdle to set the stage for a formal vote as soon as Saturday on a legislative package that would deliver $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

The package includes a fourth piece of legislation—designed to entice Republicans opposed to foreign aid—that would require ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban in the U.S.
KEY BACKGROUND
TikTok has faced years of scrutiny over whether its parent company could be beholden to the Chinese government, including fears ByteDance could pass Americans’ data to the government or use TikTok to spread propaganda. TikTok has long denied any connections to China’s government. The House passed a standalone bill last month with bipartisan support that would force the sale of TikTok or ban the social media app in the U.S., but the legislation stalled in the Senate. The latest TikTok ban included in the foreign aid package establishes a longer timeline for ByteDance to sell TikTok—270 days, plus an option for President Joe Biden to extend the deadline by 90 days—than the initial bill, which set a 180-day deadline. The extended deadline appears to have appeased some senators skeptical of the initial House TikTok bill, including Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who chairs the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that would review the TikTok legislation. Cantwell said in a statement Wednesday the extended timeline would “ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done.” A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers broadly support more controls on TikTok, citing evidence the Chinese-owned company has used it to spy on U.S. citizens.

SURPRISING FACT
Musk’s opposition to the TikTok ban comes days after he polled users on whether he should bring back the short-form video app Vine, which shut down in 2017. Nearly 70% of the 2.3 million X users polled said the company should reprise the platform.
