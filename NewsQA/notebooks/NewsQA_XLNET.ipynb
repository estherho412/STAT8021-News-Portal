His pension has been stopped and his bank account has been frozen,\\\" the statement from Norway said.\\n\\nStore said in the statement that it marked the \\\"first time a Nobel Peace Prize has been confiscated by national authorities.\\\"\\n\\nThe peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded.\\n\\nWhile the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament.\\n\\nEbadi received the prize for her focus on human rights, especially on the struggle to improve the status of women and children.\\n\\nA statement from the Nobel committee at the time said, \\\"As a lawyer, judge, lecturer, writer and activist, she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country, Iran, and far beyond its borders.\\\"\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nShirin Ebadi received prize for focus on human rights, especially women and children\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nNorway did not explain how it had learned of the alleged confiscation\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe medal and the diploma have been removed from Dr. Ebadi's bank box, say officials\",\n          \"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A newspaper advertisement for a Miami car dealership reads more like a coupon for bags of potato chips: \\\"Buy one, get two!\\\"\\n\\nIt's estimated that 900 automotive dealerships will have shut their doors by year's end.\\n\\nThe ad speaks to the desperation of car dealers as Big Three auto manufacturers beg Washington for billions in bailout dollars to combat sales that keep dipping to all-time lows.\\n\\n\\\"The first thing people think when they come in is, 'It's a fake ad. It's a normal car dealer ad. It's a gimmick.' But it's not,\\\" said Ali Ahmed, sales manager at Rob Lambdin's University Dodge in Miami.\\n\\nTo be fair, there is a catch to the buy-one-get-one-free offer: You must first buy a new Dodge truck at full retail price before you're eligible to receive a second truck for about $3,000 in tax, tags and dealer fees.\\n\\n\\\"We've been fielding phone calls and e-mail inquiries from every state in the country looking to get this buy-one-get-one deal,\\\" Ahmed said.\\n\\nAbout 700 dealerships, most of them selling cars from U.S. automakers, have shut their doors since the beginning of the year. The number is expected to hit 900 by year's end.\\n\\nLast month, National Automobile Dealers Association Chairwoman Annette Sykora told the House Financial Services Committee some 19,700 dealerships will still be around by the end of 2008, compared with 50,000 in the 1940s.\\n\\nAuto sales are at a 15-year low, she said, which affects more than the Big Three automakers. Dealers are slashing personnel and expenses. Sykora herself has had to cut staff by about 20 percent at her dealerships, she said. iReport.com: Ask the automakers your questions\\n\\nSykora, a third-generation car saleswoman who sells Big Three automobiles at dealerships in Slaton and Levelland, Texas, said she recently sat down with the superintendent of Slaton schools.\\n\\n\\\"We started discussing what would happen if the dealerships in my hometown were to close,\\\" she said during her November 19 testimony. \\\"The loss of tax revenue would force them to cut programs and teachers.\\n\\n\\\"Many displaced dealership families might have to leave town in search of work in other places, compounding the loss. This same scene would play out in hundreds of communities in the U.S.\\\"\\n\\nDealerships, Sykora explained, are independent businesses, not arms of the automakers. They invest in land, equipment, buildings and take out millions of dollars in loans to put the vehicles on their lots and showroom floors.\\n\\nShe also said car dealerships are a prime source of advertising revenue for local media, they support charities and Little League teams and they are integral to the tax base, she said.\\n\\n\\\"One-fifth of the nation's retail purchases are automobiles. By getting automotive retailing back on track, Congress can effectively leverage the economic engine of the automobile industry to get this economy running on all cylinders again,\\\" she said, pleading with Congress not to let the Big Three file for bankruptcy.  Watch what the automakers are asking for \\u00bb\\n\\nWith the world's economy reeling, expensive items like cars are not high priorities for families and businesses. It doesn't help that the credit crunch is making it difficult to get loans, which the majority of U.S. consumers need to purchase vehicles.\\n\\nAlso compounding matters is consumer confidence, which hit an all-time low in October and didn't improve much in November, according to the nonprofit Conference Board, which maintains indices on consumers' trust in the marketplace.\\n\\nAccording to Autodata, car sales have plummeted since last year. In the United States, the number of sales of passenger cars and light trucks in November 2008 was down 36.7 percent from November 2007 -- from about 1.18 million to 747,000.\\n\\nAlso, as of November 2008, automakers had sold about 12.35 million cars and light trucks, compared with 14.76 million during the same time period last year -- a drop of 16.3 percent, according to Autodata's summary of U.S. light vehicle retail sales.\\n\\nComparing November 2008 sales with those in November 2007, Autodata reported that General Motors saw a 41.3 percent drop, Ford a 30.5 percent drop and Chrysler 47.1 percent.\\n\\nBut it's not just U.S. automakers taking a hit: Toyota's vehicle sales declined 33.9 percent, Honda's dipped 31.6 percent and Nissan's dropped 42.2 percent during that time period, Autodata reported.\\n\\n\\\"It's definitely a tough climate right now,\\\" said Matt Lee, floor manager for Major World Auto in New York. \\\"A lot of people are saying it's a perfect storm of gas prices and financing and consumer confidence.\\\"\\n\\nMajor World Auto used to sell about 150 cars a month. It now sells about half that, Lee said. And of the 15 to 20 salespeople who used to roam the salesroom floor, about 10 are left, he said.\\n\\n\\\"Salesmen actually just walked out because they're not making enough money to support their family,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMajor World has stopped bringing in new models because it can't sell the cars it has. Like University Dodge in Miami, it is resorting to some creative sales pitches, including zero-percent financing for 72 months and rebates of up to $7,500.\\n\\nBut even with the bargains, car dealers are having trouble getting customers into the showrooms. In a recent CNN visit to Major World, which lasted about two hours, only one customer walked onto the lot -- to browse.\\n\\n\\\"Where you would see five people a day coming in to at least look at a car per salesmen, you're getting maybe one person a day or two people a day,\\\" salesman Jamie Krinsky said.\\n\\nIf the Big Three file for bankruptcy, Sykora told Congress last month, sales and confidence will continue to plummet.\\n\\n\\\"Imagine how banks would react to a dealer who has asked for millions of dollars to finance new and used inventories from an automaker going through 'reorganization,' \\\" she said.   Watch whether a bailout would come too late for dealers \\u00bb\\n\\nThe government can help boost auto sales in many ways, Sykora said, citing two proposed tax incentives: one that would make interest payments on car loans tax deductible and another that would encourage consumers to upgrade their older cars for more fuel-efficient models. \\\"Cash for clunkers\\\" programs are in place in Texas and California, she said.\\n\\n\\\"Whether it's my dealerships in Texas or it's the dealership in your community, the fact is local dealerships will be a major factor in our economic recovery,\\\" she told the House committee. \\\"To get the economy back on track, we must restore consumer demand, and the only way to do that is to restore consumer confidence.\\\"\\n\\nCNN's Alina Cho and Eliott C.

He became known as the \\\"voiceless Sinatra,\\\" despite a singing voice that landed him roles alongside June Allyson and Judy Garland in \\\"Two Girls and a Sailor\\\" and \\\"In the Good Old Summertime,\\\" according to TCM.com.\\n\\nJohnson was born August 25, 1916, to a plumber and housewife in Newport, Rhode Island. He was 16 years old when he left Rhode Island for New York City so he could forge a career in acting, Bleiweiss said.\\n\\nA few years later, he got his break from Lucille Ball, she said.\\n\\n\\\"She saw this redhead kid and said, 'Let's give him a break. He seems like he can do some acting,' \\\" Bleiweiss said.\\n\\nJohnson made his Broadway debut in 1936 in \\\"New Faces of 1936\\\" before legendary director-playwright George Abbott hired him as a chorus member and understudy to the three male leads in Rodgers and Hart's \\\"Too Many Girls\\\" in 1939.\\n\\nThe next year, Abbott cast him as a chorus boy and Gene Kelly's understudy in Rodgers and Hart's groundbreaking musical \\\"Pal Joey,\\\" according to TCM.com. His film debut followed in 1940 with a role in the chorus of \\\"Too Many Girls.\\\"\\n\\nWhile en route to a screening in 1942, he was in a car wreck that left him with a metal plate in his head and kept him out of the military. But that didn't stop him from acting in war films.\\n\\nTwo years later, he received top billing in \\\"Two Girls and a Sailor.\\\" Other big roles included \\\"A Guy Named Joe,\\\" \\\"Brigadoon\\\" and \\\"The Caine Mutiny.\\\"\\n\\nIn 1947, Johnson married former actor Eve Lynn Johnson, who had previously been married to a close friend of Johnson's, Keenan Wynn. The two did not have children and divorced in 1968, according to TCM.com\\n\\nJohnson had a daughter, Schuyler Van Johnson, by another woman, according to TCM.com.\\n\\nAs Johnson entered middle age, his features grew heavy but he still managed to find offbeat roles in films including \\\"The Bottom of the Bottle,\\\" an unabashed melodrama in which he played an alcoholic, and \\\"23 Paces to Baker Street\\\" as a blind detective.\\n\\nAs film roles became scarce, Johnson filled the gaps with stage work. He appeared in \\\"The Music Man\\\" in London, England, in 1961 and returned to Broadway in 1962 for \\\"Come on Strong.\\\"\\n\\nIn Woody Allen's 1985 comedy, \\\"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\\\" Johnson played one of the actors trapped inside the film screen in a parody of sorts of films from the 1930s.\\n\\nIn 1987, Johnson was praised for his work in the Broadway production of \\\"La Cage aux Folles.\\\" He last appeared on stage four years ago in \\\"Love Letters\\\" in a community theater in nearby Suffern, New York, but decided afterward that he would do no more, Bleiweiss said.\\n\\n\\\"He said he had seen it and done it all and now he was just going to sit back and take it easy. Those were his words,\\\" she said.\\n\\nJohnson retained much of his youthful energy as he grew older, and became a frequent interview subject on the old days of Hollywood and his lengthy career, TCM.com said.\\n\\nBleiweiss said she met Johnson when he moved into the home, where she was a case manager at the time.\\n\\n\\\"He still was tall and striking,\\\" she said. \\\"He was one of the all-time old actors.\\\"\\n\\nHis ability to communicate was hampered by the loss of his hearing. Instead, he passed the time by painting, needlepoint and crocheting, she said.\\n\\nThough he didn't cook, he loved watching cooking shows and reruns of \\\"The Golden Girls,\\\" she said.\\n\\nBleiweiss said Johnson was estranged from his daughter and stepchildren for most of his life, but children brightened his day.\\n\\n\\\"When he saw them, he'd smile and wave to them,\\\" she said. \\\"It always brought a smile to his face.\\\"\\n\\nA private service will be held.\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nJohnson died Friday morning at 92 in an assisted-living facility in Nyack, New York\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHis career stretched over six decades and across genres, from war films to musicals\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nJohnson's youthful charm earned him nickname the \\\"voiceless Sinatra\\\" in his heyday\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHe got top billing in \\\"Two Girls and a Sailor;\\\" praised for role in \\\"La Cage aux Folles\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"start-end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 36271,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"month and is to head to\",\n          \"their filing that the judge should accept the probation office's recommendation that Bonds be sentenced to two years' probation, fined $4,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service.\",\n          \"Juszkiewicz\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded.\\n\\nWhile the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament.\\n\\nEbadi received the prize for her focus on human rights, especially on the struggle to improve the status of women and children.\\n\\nA statement from the Nobel committee at the time said, \\\"As a lawyer, judge, lecturer, writer and activist, she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country, Iran, and far beyond its borders.\\\"\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nShirin Ebadi received prize for focus on human rights, especially women and children\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nNorway did not explain how it had learned of the alleged confiscation\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe medal and the diploma have been removed from Dr. Ebadi's bank box, say officials\",\n          \"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A newspaper advertisement for a Miami car dealership reads more like a coupon for bags of potato chips: \\\"Buy one, get two!\\\"\\n\\nIt's estimated that 900 automotive dealerships will have shut their doors by year's end.\\n\\nThe ad speaks to the desperation of car dealers as Big Three auto manufacturers beg Washington for billions in bailout dollars to combat sales that keep dipping to all-time lows.\\n\\n\\\"The first thing people think when they come in is, 'It's a fake ad. It's a normal car dealer ad. It's a gimmick.' But it's not,\\\" said Ali Ahmed, sales manager at Rob Lambdin's University Dodge in Miami.\\n\\nTo be fair, there is a catch to the buy-one-get-one-free offer: You must first buy a new Dodge truck at full retail price before you're eligible to receive a second truck for about $3,000 in tax, tags and dealer fees.\\n\\n\\\"We've been fielding phone calls and e-mail inquiries from every state in the country looking to get this buy-one-get-one deal,\\\" Ahmed said.\\n\\nAbout 700 dealerships, most of them selling cars from U.S. automakers, have shut their doors since the beginning of the year. The number is expected to hit 900 by year's end.\\n\\nLast month, National Automobile Dealers Association Chairwoman Annette Sykora told the House Financial Services Committee some 19,700 dealerships will still be around by the end of 2008, compared with 50,000 in the 1940s.\\n\\nAuto sales are at a 15-year low, she said, which affects more than the Big Three automakers. Dealers are slashing personnel and expenses. Sykora herself has had to cut staff by about 20 percent at her dealerships, she said. iReport.com: Ask the automakers your questions\\n\\nSykora, a third-generation car saleswoman who sells Big Three automobiles at dealerships in Slaton and Levelland, Texas, said she recently sat down with the superintendent of Slaton schools.\\n\\n\\\"We started discussing what would happen if the dealerships in my hometown were to close,\\\" she said during her November 19 testimony. \\\"The loss of tax revenue would force them to cut programs and teachers.\\n\\n\\\"Many displaced dealership families might have to leave town in search of work in other places, compounding the loss. This same scene would play out in hundreds of communities in the U.S.\\\"\\n\\nDealerships, Sykora explained, are independent businesses, not arms of the automakers. They invest in land, equipment, buildings and take out millions of dollars in loans to put the vehicles on their lots and showroom floors.\\n\\nShe also said car dealerships are a prime source of advertising revenue for local media, they support charities and Little League teams and they are integral to the tax base, she said.\\n\\n\\\"One-fifth of the nation's retail purchases are automobiles. By getting automotive retailing back on track, Congress can effectively leverage the economic engine of the automobile industry to get this economy running on all cylinders again,\\\" she said, pleading with Congress not to let the Big Three file for bankruptcy.  Watch what the automakers are asking for \\u00bb\\n\\nWith the world's economy reeling, expensive items like cars are not high priorities for families and businesses. It doesn't help that the credit crunch is making it difficult to get loans, which the majority of U.S. consumers need to purchase vehicles.\\n\\nAlso compounding matters is consumer confidence, which hit an all-time low in October and didn't improve much in November, according to the nonprofit Conference Board, which maintains indices on consumers' trust in the marketplace.\\n\\nAccording to Autodata, car sales have plummeted since last year. In the United States, the number of sales of passenger cars and light trucks in November 2008 was down 36.7 percent from November 2007 -- from about 1.18 million to 747,000.\\n\\nAlso, as of November 2008, automakers had sold about 12.35 million cars and light trucks, compared with 14.76 million during the same time period last year -- a drop of 16.3 percent, according to Autodata's summary of U.S. light vehicle retail sales.\\n\\nComparing November 2008 sales with those in November 2007, Autodata reported that General Motors saw a 41.3 percent drop, Ford a 30.5 percent drop and Chrysler 47.1 percent.\\n\\nBut it's not just U.S. automakers taking a hit: Toyota's vehicle sales declined 33.9 percent, Honda's dipped 31.6 percent and Nissan's dropped 42.2 percent during that time period, Autodata reported.\\n\\n\\\"It's definitely a tough climate right now,\\\" said Matt Lee, floor manager for Major World Auto in New York. \\\"A lot of people are saying it's a perfect storm of gas prices and financing and consumer confidence.\\\"\\n\\nMajor World Auto used to sell about 150 cars a month. It now sells about half that, Lee said. And of the 15 to 20 salespeople who used to roam the salesroom floor, about 10 are left, he said.\\n\\n\\\"Salesmen actually just walked out because they're not making enough money to support their family,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMajor World has stopped bringing in new models because it can't sell the cars it has. Like University Dodge in Miami, it is resorting to some creative sales pitches, including zero-percent financing for 72 months and rebates of up to $7,500.\\n\\nBut even with the bargains, car dealers are having trouble getting customers into the showrooms. In a recent CNN visit to Major World, which lasted about two hours, only one customer walked onto the lot -- to browse.\\n\\n\\\"Where you would see five people a day coming in to at least look at a car per salesmen, you're getting maybe one person a day or two people a day,\\\" salesman Jamie Krinsky said.\\n\\nIf the Big Three file for bankruptcy, Sykora told Congress last month, sales and confidence will continue to plummet.\\n\\n\\\"Imagine how banks would react to a dealer who has asked for millions of dollars to finance new and used inventories from an automaker going through 'reorganization,' \\\" she said.   Watch whether a bailout would come too late for dealers \\u00bb\\n\\nThe government can help boost auto sales in many ways, Sykora said, citing two proposed tax incentives: one that would make interest payments on car loans tax deductible and another that would encourage consumers to upgrade their older cars for more fuel-efficient models. \\\"Cash for clunkers\\\" programs are in place in Texas and California, she said.\\n\\n\\\"Whether it's my dealerships in Texas or it's the dealership in your community, the fact is local dealerships will be a major factor in our economic recovery,\\\" she told the House committee. \\\"To get the economy back on track, we must restore consumer demand, and the only way to do that is to restore consumer confidence.\\\"\\n\\nCNN's Alina Cho and Eliott C.

He became known as the \\\"voiceless Sinatra,\\\" despite a singing voice that landed him roles alongside June Allyson and Judy Garland in \\\"Two Girls and a Sailor\\\" and \\\"In the Good Old Summertime,\\\" according to TCM.com.\\n\\nJohnson was born August 25, 1916, to a plumber and housewife in Newport, Rhode Island. He was 16 years old when he left Rhode Island for New York City so he could forge a career in acting, Bleiweiss said.\\n\\nA few years later, he got his break from Lucille Ball, she said.\\n\\n\\\"She saw this redhead kid and said, 'Let's give him a break. He seems like he can do some acting,' \\\" Bleiweiss said.\\n\\nJohnson made his Broadway debut in 1936 in \\\"New Faces of 1936\\\" before legendary director-playwright George Abbott hired him as a chorus member and understudy to the three male leads in Rodgers and Hart's \\\"Too Many Girls\\\" in 1939.\\n\\nThe next year, Abbott cast him as a chorus boy and Gene Kelly's understudy in Rodgers and Hart's groundbreaking musical \\\"Pal Joey,\\\" according to TCM.com. His film debut followed in 1940 with a role in the chorus of \\\"Too Many Girls.\\\"\\n\\nWhile en route to a screening in 1942, he was in a car wreck that left him with a metal plate in his head and kept him out of the military. But that didn't stop him from acting in war films.\\n\\nTwo years later, he received top billing in \\\"Two Girls and a Sailor.\\\" Other big roles included \\\"A Guy Named Joe,\\\" \\\"Brigadoon\\\" and \\\"The Caine Mutiny.\\\"\\n\\nIn 1947, Johnson married former actor Eve Lynn Johnson, who had previously been married to a close friend of Johnson's, Keenan Wynn. The two did not have children and divorced in 1968, according to TCM.com\\n\\nJohnson had a daughter, Schuyler Van Johnson, by another woman, according to TCM.com.\\n\\nAs Johnson entered middle age, his features grew heavy but he still managed to find offbeat roles in films including \\\"The Bottom of the Bottle,\\\" an unabashed melodrama in which he played an alcoholic, and \\\"23 Paces to Baker Street\\\" as a blind detective.\\n\\nAs film roles became scarce, Johnson filled the gaps with stage work. He appeared in \\\"The Music Man\\\" in London, England, in 1961 and returned to Broadway in 1962 for \\\"Come on Strong.\\\"\\n\\nIn Woody Allen's 1985 comedy, \\\"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\\\" Johnson played one of the actors trapped inside the film screen in a parody of sorts of films from the 1930s.\\n\\nIn 1987, Johnson was praised for his work in the Broadway production of \\\"La Cage aux Folles.\\\" He last appeared on stage four years ago in \\\"Love Letters\\\" in a community theater in nearby Suffern, New York, but decided afterward that he would do no more, Bleiweiss said.\\n\\n\\\"He said he had seen it and done it all and now he was just going to sit back and take it easy. Those were his words,\\\" she said.\\n\\nJohnson retained much of his youthful energy as he grew older, and became a frequent interview subject on the old days of Hollywood and his lengthy career, TCM.com said.\\n\\nBleiweiss said she met Johnson when he moved into the home, where she was a case manager at the time.\\n\\n\\\"He still was tall and striking,\\\" she said. \\\"He was one of the all-time old actors.\\\"\\n\\nHis ability to communicate was hampered by the loss of his hearing. Instead, he passed the time by painting, needlepoint and crocheting, she said.\\n\\nThough he didn't cook, he loved watching cooking shows and reruns of \\\"The Golden Girls,\\\" she said.\\n\\nBleiweiss said Johnson was estranged from his daughter and stepchildren for most of his life, but children brightened his day.\\n\\n\\\"When he saw them, he'd smile and wave to them,\\\" she said. \\\"It always brought a smile to his face.\\\"\\n\\nA private service will be held.\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nJohnson died Friday morning at 92 in an assisted-living facility in Nyack, New York\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHis career stretched over six decades and across genres, from war films to musicals\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nJohnson's youthful charm earned him nickname the \\\"voiceless Sinatra\\\" in his heyday\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHe got top billing in \\\"Two Girls and a Sailor;\\\" praised for role in \\\"La Cage aux Folles\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"start-end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Despite his firebrand reputation, he later confounded liberal supporters in 1982 by joining the conservative United Malays National Organization (UMNO) led by Mahathir.\\n\\nAt the time, Mahathir's ability to bring Anwar on board was seen as a master political stroke, effectively neutralizing a potentially powerful political opponent who risked joining the opposition Parti Islam or PAS.\\n\\nAnwar found not guilty of sodomy\\n\\nHe moved quickly through the political ranks throughout the 1980s, heading several ministries until he became deputy prime minister and the favored lieutenant of Mahathir in 1993.\\n\\nBut by the end of the 1990s, the relationship had begun to sour as Anwar became increasingly vocal about what he saw as widespread nepotism and cronyism within the Malaysian government.\\n\\nProtectionist policies set up by Mahathir also came under fire from Anwar, who supported the International Monetary Fund's recovery plan for Malaysia following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.\\n\\nAnwar instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and put major infrastructure projects on hold. These mega-projects had been the cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy and his opposition further strained the relationship. Mahathir, as prime minister, reversed several Anwar decisions.\\n\\nNevertheless, the tough medicine of the IMF package meant Malaysia emerged from the crisis sooner than its neighbors. It is currently moving away from manufacturing as a base for its economy, and is now a world center of Islamic banking and knowledge-based industries.\\n\\nIn 1998, Anwar was fired from the cabinet amid police reports he was under investigation on charges of sodomy -- an illegal act in predominantly Muslim Malaysia. Anwar denied the allegations.\\n\\nAppearing in court with a black eye from a beating while in police custody- an injury that then Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor later admitted in a royal commission he had personally administered -- Anwar pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nAfter a two-year trial, which also involved corruption charges, Anwar was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in jail for sodomy and six years, served concurrently, for corruption.\\n\\nIn December 2004, Anwar was cleared of the sodomy charges, and in 2006 he announced his bid to run for parliament in the 2008 elections after the expiration of a ban from public office related to his earlier conviction. In the 2008 elections, the opposition seriously dented the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority, handing it one of its worst election results since independence in 1957.\\n\\nIn what the Malaysian media had dubbed \\\"Sodomy 2.0,\\\" the opposition leader -- just months after the 2008 elections -- was again charged with sodomy on the basis of allegations from his aide Modh Saiful Bukhari Azlan who claimed Anwar had repeatedly sexually assaulted him.\\n\\nAnwar dismissed the charges as a sham, saying they were concocted by the ruling coalition in an effort to discredit him.\\n\\nAnwar has consistently claimed that the charges were trumped up and the last desperate act of a government fighting for its political survival. The government, for its part, has denied any involvement in the case against Anwar.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that the same plot that was hatched in 1998 is being repeated reflects a certain bankruptcy and lack of creativity on their part,\\\" Anwar told CNN in 2010.\\n\\n\\\"They must still believe some segment of the Malay-Muslim electorate, who will likely determine the outcome of the next General Election, will be alienated by these charges. I doubt that is the case.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a nearly three-year trial, a Malaysian court Monday found Anwar not guilty of the charges against him after the judge said there were questions over whether DNA evidence had been contaminated.\\n\\nInformation Minister Rais Yatim hailed the verdict as a victory for Malaysia's judiciary, showing that it was free from government influence. With the government expected to call elections in the coming months, Anwar said he was ready to start campaigning again and challenge the ruling coalition's 50-year hold on power.\\n\\nAnwar has brought together a diverse group of opposition parties, including a conservative ethnic Malay Islamic party, a secular party mainly representative of ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities and his own multiracial party.\\n\\nAt the heart of Malaysia's reform movement is the call for a multiracial alternative to the political status quo in the South East Asian nation.\\n\\nMalaysia's controversial policy of bumiputra -- a Malay term which means literally means \\\"son of the soil\\\" -- favors the ethnic Malay majority, providing them with preference in employment, business, education and housing.\\n\\nWhile proponents say the radical affirmative action campaign -- which was instituted in the early 1970s in response to anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia in 1969 -- has lifted many urban Malays into the middle class, critics say that Chinese, Indian and the indigenous Orang Asli have been excluded from the political process.\\n\\nWhile problems with bumiputra were among the election issues, allegations of government cronyism and nepotism are now high on the list of voter concerns.\\n\\nDubbed the post-reformasi generation, educated young Malaysians in their 20s and 30s have been leaving the country to take up opportunities overseas. The brain drain is now a serious problem for the coalition government which has embarked on economic reforms, but is accused of doing little to reform the public service or education.\\n\\nAccording to Herizal Hazri, the Malaysian program director for The Asia Foundation, Anwar's acquittal will give a boost to the speed of reform.\\n\\n\\\"Anwar still represents the reform agenda,\\\" he said. \\\"The anti-corruption drives and drive towards good governance also illuminate a more welcoming view of as to how ethnicities should be treated in Malaysia.\\\"\\n\\nHe said both the opposition and the government were pursuing reforms, swinging the attention of the reform movement towards problems of corruption rather than issues of ethnicity and race.\\n\\nOne of the unintended consequences of the Anwar case, he added, was that Malaysia's British-based legal system had emerged as an independent force in a political structure that critics charge has been compromised by decades of cronyism.\\n\\n\\\"I would have to say that for once I am proud of a Malaysian institution,\\\" Hazri said. \\\"The court has been strong enough to make a decision outside of politics and it needs to be applauded.\\n\\n\\\"The court made its decision based solely on the facts of the case. Today is a victory for the Malaysian judicial system and I hope that it heralds a bright new future,\\\" he said.\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nAnwar has spent more than a decade fighting sodomy charges\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe one-time student activist was once Mahathir's right-hand man\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe opposition leader dented the ruling party's majority at elections in 2008\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nAnwar has led a reform movement that has targeted social and political reform\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"start-end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Despite his firebrand reputation, he later confounded liberal supporters in 1982 by joining the conservative United Malays National Organization (UMNO) led by Mahathir.\\n\\nAt the time, Mahathir's ability to bring Anwar on board was seen as a master political stroke, effectively neutralizing a potentially powerful political opponent who risked joining the opposition Parti Islam or PAS.\\n\\nAnwar found not guilty of sodomy\\n\\nHe moved quickly through the political ranks throughout the 1980s, heading several ministries until he became deputy prime minister and the favored lieutenant of Mahathir in 1993.\\n\\nBut by the end of the 1990s, the relationship had begun to sour as Anwar became increasingly vocal about what he saw as widespread nepotism and cronyism within the Malaysian government.\\n\\nProtectionist policies set up by Mahathir also came under fire from Anwar, who supported the International Monetary Fund's recovery plan for Malaysia following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.\\n\\nAnwar instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and put major infrastructure projects on hold. These mega-projects had been the cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy and his opposition further strained the relationship. Mahathir, as prime minister, reversed several Anwar decisions.\\n\\nNevertheless, the tough medicine of the IMF package meant Malaysia emerged from the crisis sooner than its neighbors. It is currently moving away from manufacturing as a base for its economy, and is now a world center of Islamic banking and knowledge-based industries.\\n\\nIn 1998, Anwar was fired from the cabinet amid police reports he was under investigation on charges of sodomy -- an illegal act in predominantly Muslim Malaysia. Anwar denied the allegations.\\n\\nAppearing in court with a black eye from a beating while in police custody- an injury that then Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor later admitted in a royal commission he had personally administered -- Anwar pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nAfter a two-year trial, which also involved corruption charges, Anwar was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in jail for sodomy and six years, served concurrently, for corruption.\\n\\nIn December 2004, Anwar was cleared of the sodomy charges, and in 2006 he announced his bid to run for parliament in the 2008 elections after the expiration of a ban from public office related to his earlier conviction. In the 2008 elections, the opposition seriously dented the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority, handing it one of its worst election results since independence in 1957.\\n\\nIn what the Malaysian media had dubbed \\\"Sodomy 2.0,\\\" the opposition leader -- just months after the 2008 elections -- was again charged with sodomy on the basis of allegations from his aide Modh Saiful Bukhari Azlan who claimed Anwar had repeatedly sexually assaulted him.\\n\\nAnwar dismissed the charges as a sham, saying they were concocted by the ruling coalition in an effort to discredit him.\\n\\nAnwar has consistently claimed that the charges were trumped up and the last desperate act of a government fighting for its political survival. The government, for its part, has denied any involvement in the case against Anwar.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that the same plot that was hatched in 1998 is being repeated reflects a certain bankruptcy and lack of creativity on their part,\\\" Anwar told CNN in 2010.\\n\\n\\\"They must still believe some segment of the Malay-Muslim electorate, who will likely determine the outcome of the next General Election, will be alienated by these charges. I doubt that is the case.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a nearly three-year trial, a Malaysian court Monday found Anwar not guilty of the charges against him after the judge said there were questions over whether DNA evidence had been contaminated.\\n\\nInformation Minister Rais Yatim hailed the verdict as a victory for Malaysia's judiciary, showing that it was free from government influence. With the government expected to call elections in the coming months, Anwar said he was ready to start campaigning again and challenge the ruling coalition's 50-year hold on power.\\n\\nAnwar has brought together a diverse group of opposition parties, including a conservative ethnic Malay Islamic party, a secular party mainly representative of ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities and his own multiracial party.\\n\\nAt the heart of Malaysia's reform movement is the call for a multiracial alternative to the political status quo in the South East Asian nation.\\n\\nMalaysia's controversial policy of bumiputra -- a Malay term which means literally means \\\"son of the soil\\\" -- favors the ethnic Malay majority, providing them with preference in employment, business, education and housing.\\n\\nWhile proponents say the radical affirmative action campaign -- which was instituted in the early 1970s in response to anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia in 1969 -- has lifted many urban Malays into the middle class, critics say that Chinese, Indian and the indigenous Orang Asli have been excluded from the political process.\\n\\nWhile problems with bumiputra were among the election issues, allegations of government cronyism and nepotism are now high on the list of voter concerns.\\n\\nDubbed the post-reformasi generation, educated young Malaysians in their 20s and 30s have been leaving the country to take up opportunities overseas. The brain drain is now a serious problem for the coalition government which has embarked on economic reforms, but is accused of doing little to reform the public service or education.\\n\\nAccording to Herizal Hazri, the Malaysian program director for The Asia Foundation, Anwar's acquittal will give a boost to the speed of reform.\\n\\n\\\"Anwar still represents the reform agenda,\\\" he said. \\\"The anti-corruption drives and drive towards good governance also illuminate a more welcoming view of as to how ethnicities should be treated in Malaysia.\\\"\\n\\nHe said both the opposition and the government were pursuing reforms, swinging the attention of the reform movement towards problems of corruption rather than issues of ethnicity and race.\\n\\nOne of the unintended consequences of the Anwar case, he added, was that Malaysia's British-based legal system had emerged as an independent force in a political structure that critics charge has been compromised by decades of cronyism.\\n\\n\\\"I would have to say that for once I am proud of a Malaysian institution,\\\" Hazri said. \\\"The court has been strong enough to make a decision outside of politics and it needs to be applauded.\\n\\n\\\"The court made its decision based solely on the facts of the case. Today is a victory for the Malaysian judicial system and I hope that it heralds a bright new future,\\\" he said.\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nAnwar has spent more than a decade fighting sodomy charges\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe one-time student activist was once Mahathir's right-hand man\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe opposition leader dented the ruling party's majority at elections in 2008\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nAnwar has led a reform movement that has targeted social and political reform\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"start-end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
