Of course, this year is very different, and when I talked to pediatric emergency room specialists around the country, they reinforced summer safety advice, while noting some of the special twists and dangers of this dangerous and twisty time. \\\"Everyone has cabin fever, and they want to get out and have a good time,\\\" said Dr. Mark Zonfrillo, an associate professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. And even as many parents may feel that it's all they can do to enforce social distancing and mask-wearing, it's important to remember the safety measures from the before times as well. Dr. Maya Haasz, an attending physician in the pediatric emergency room at Children's Hospital Colorado and an assistant professor at University of Colorado School of Medicine, said they are seeing injuries that reflect a summer of individual activity rather than team sports. Kids are out riding their bikes and their scooters, she said, but not always wearing helmets. \\\"We're seeing more significant head injuries,\\\" she said.\\n\\n[Sign up for the Well Family newsletter] And because some parents are still scared to go to hospitals, injured children are sometimes not coming in immediately. The delay can be painful for the child and problematic for the doctors, for example if a laceration is more than a day old, and can't be safely sewn up. \\\"We're doing a tremendous amount to keep the hospital safe,\\\" Dr. Haasz said. \\\"You are not at risk of getting Covid in the hospital.\\\" But to help keep kids out of the emergency room, remember the sunscreen and the bike helmets and the adult supervision for kids in the water. Drowning is the leading cause of death for children from 1 to 4 and it can happen silently and swiftly, leaving behind devastated families and regrets that never go away. Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, a pediatric emergency physician and assistant professor at Emory in Atlanta, said that in 2018, 443 children from 1 to 4 died from drowning, and that it kills about 1,000 children of all ages every year. There are two peaks in age, she said, first the toddlers and young children who accidentally gain access to a body of water, and then the adolescents, the risk-takers, \\\"who might be horsing around, sneaking into pools.\\\"\\n\\nWith the pandemic, children may not be going to community pools, where there would be lifeguards, and the home pool market has been booming. \\\"A lot of people are getting new pools and first-time pools, so with that comes a responsibility for not only proper barriers and pool gates, but also proper supervision in an era of distraction,\\\" Dr. Zonfrillo said. Parents need to think about layers of safety, Dr. Agarwal said, such as having a four-foot tall fence around the entire pool, but also alarms. Parental supervision is key. \\\"We recommend for younger children and not experienced swimmers that they should always be within arm's reach,\\\" Dr. Agarwal said. Parents should not assume they can rely on a lifeguard, who will have many swimmers to watch. Even kiddie pools and shallow bodies of water can be dangerous, Dr. Zonfrillo said: \\\"A toddler can drown in just a few inches of water.\\\" If you have a trampoline, supervise children carefully, follow all safety instructions, and make sure there is only one child on the trampoline at a time. Trampoline sales have gone up in the pandemic, and doctors have been very concerned about trampoline-related fractures and trips to the emergency room. \\\"A bunch of kids on a trampoline can really cause a lot of injury,\\\" Dr. Agarwal said. Be mindful of bike safety, be vigilant about helmets. And remember that kids can get badly injured on scooters and on all-terrain vehicles, or ATVs. ATVs are very common, especially in rural communities, Dr. Agarwal said, and nationally, about four children are seen in an emergency department every hour with ATV injuries. She recently treated a child who had taken \\\"every single precaution,\\\" she said. \\\"He was on a designated ATV recreational area, he had a helmet, he was supervised, he had no passengers -- and yet he still managed to roll over his ATV on himself.\\\" Bottom line: Although she understands their appeal, Dr. Agarwal said, \\\"Don't put your kid on an ATV.\\\" Take the summer sun seriously: Keep children in the shade as much as possible, use hats and protective clothing in addition to sunscreen. Apply lots of sunscreen, reapply it every couple of hours, and after children go in the water. Make sure children stay hydrated, especially if they're exercising. Children who are engaged in athletics should start hydrating before they go out to practice, Dr. Agarwal said, and if they haven't been practicing during the shutdown, they should ease back in, and be particularly careful about hydration and heat exposure when they go back to practicing. Heat stroke is always a worry, especially vehicular heat stroke, which happens when small children are left in cars. Many doctors were worried that the pandemic might put children at additional risk, if parents who are reluctant to take them into stores leave them in vehicles. \\\"In hot temperatures, the temperature in the car can rise within minutes,\\\" Dr. Zonfrillo said. Ideally, parents should leave children at home while they do errands.\\n\\nThis year, Dr. Agarwal said, the numbers are actually looking a little better. For the past two years, over 50 children a year have died from heat stroke; there have been 11 deaths so far this year. Be aware of the danger posed by firearms that are not properly secured and stored. Firearms are not specifically a summer risk, but this is a summer of children not going to camp, and home injuries loom large. Firearm sales have increased in the pandemic, and Dr. Agarwal says that pediatric emergency doctors are worrying over these new owners especially, and whether they are storing the guns safely -- they should be stored unloaded, locked up in a gun safe or with a trigger lock, and with the ammunition locked up in a separate location. \\\"I want to encourage all parents to ask about the presence of unsecured firearms in any home where children go to visit,\\\" Dr. Agarwal said. Other at-home injuries to avoid in an at-home summer include poisonings and falls, especially falls from windows. A window screen alone is not a sufficient protection. Be aware that even the substances you're using to protect your children can be toxic; the pandemic has meant increased poisoning incidents involving hand sanitizers. Dr. Zonfrillo emphasized the importance of what he called \\\"re-child-proofing the home, based on the child's developmental age.\\\" Social isolation may be taking a toll, especially on children who suffer from anxiety or depression, and on those who may not have been able to get help and therapy virtually. On the other hand, as children begin to interact more, whether in person or virtually, and even start school again, doctors worry about bullying. Dr. Haasz said this is a time for \\\"really keeping an eye out for friends and family who have mental health concerns.\\\" To help keep vulnerable children safe, it's again important to be sure the home is injury-proofed, she said: \\\"Lock up anything they could use to hurt themselves, even seemingly benign medications like Tylenol and Benadryl.\\\" And if you're worried about your child's mental health, she said, bring it up. \\\"You are not going to harm your child by asking them questions,\\\" she said. \\\"If you are concerned about them, talk to them. If you're concerned they're going to hurt themselves, bring them into the hospital.\\\" Dr. Perri Klass is the author of the forthcoming book \\\"A Good Time to Be Born: How Science and Public Health Gave Children a Future,\\\" on how our world has been transformed by the radical decline of infant and child mortality.\",\n          \"Racism, revenge and a cross-cultural romance compete for screen time in Paul Ireland's \\\"Measure for Measure,\\\" a dolorous reimagining of Shakespeare's play set in and around a tower block in Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nReplacing the comedy of the original with grime and violence, the movie opens with a mass shooting as a meth-addled Afghanistan veteran mows down a group of innocent, multiracial residents. This initial brutality matters less than its reverberations among the various lowlifes who share the block, most importantly the crime lord Duke (Hugo Weaving, placid and patriarchal), an old-school villain with a moral code to match.\",\n          \"Otis Redding's \\\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\\\" became a hit after his 1967 death. This week in New York, it will be celebrated at the Apollo.\\n\\nA posthumous pop hit collapses triumph and sorrow into a single song. Only a handful of performers have reached No. 1 with a single after their deaths, including John Lennon, Janis Joplin and the Notorious B.I.G. But the first person to do it was the soul singer Otis Redding, who died in a plane crash in late 1967 at 26 and topped the charts for four weeks the following March and April with a beautifully melancholy song, \\\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay.\\\" The song ranked as the sixth-most-played composition on American radio and television in the 20th century. It has gone triple platinum and been covered by artists from Cher to Bob Dylan. Rolling Stone named it No. 26 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. To celebrate its endurance across 50 years, the Otis Redding Foundation is organizing a benefit concert on Thursday at the Apollo Theater, hosted by Whoopi Goldberg and featuring a lineup including Warren Haynes, Aloe Blacc and Booker T. Jones. The Dap-Kings and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band will provide the backup. Paul Janeway of St. Paul and the Broken Bones is scheduled to perform \\\"Down in the Valley\\\" and \\\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\\" at the event. He said that before his band had any original material, it performed complete albums by Redding. The lesson: \\\"As a singer, range is great, but you got to learn to sing the right notes the right way. Otis was one of the masters of that -- he was so emotive.\\\" And the reason behind the success of \\\"Dock of the Bay\\\"? \\\"It sounds like the title,\\\" Mr. Janeway said.\\n\\nGrace Slick, the lead singer of Jefferson Airplane, saw him at the Fillmore West in San Francisco in 1966. \\\"It was the most stunning performance I had seen up to that point,\\\" she said in a phone interview from Malibu. She remembered the stage swaying as he moved around it: \\\"I'd never seen anybody with that much positive thrust, for lack of a better term.\\\" The next summer, Redding delivered a barnburner set at the Monterey Pop Festival. \\\"This was the 'love crowd,'\\\" the record producer and Monterey organizer Lou Adler said in a phone interview. \\\"He was aware of what he was getting into but had no idea of what the response would be. As much as the performer gave at Monterey, the audience gave it right back.\\\" Zelma Redding, the singer's widow, said that after her husband had flown from the festival to their ranch in Macon, Ga., he told her, \\\"I got a new audience.\\\"\\n\\nRedding threw himself into the project of reinventing himself. \\\"It was clear that his bread and butter, which was these big 12/8 ballads, had plateaued,\\\" Jonathan Gould, the author of the recent biography \\\"Otis Redding: An Unfinished Life,\\\" said in an interview. \\\"He had done what he could do with them, which was more than anybody else could do.\\\" Like most of the world, Redding spent the summer of 1967 listening to the Beatles' \\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\\" \\\"He thought it was the greatest thing he ever heard,\\\" Ms. Redding said, speaking from her office in Georgia. \\\"I guess he was thinking about 'How can I be this creative?'\\\" In August 1967, Redding returned to San Francisco for a week of shows at the jazz club Basin Street West. When he was besieged by female fans at his hotel, the promoter Bill Graham let him stay at his houseboat in Sausalito. Redding spent his days quietly looking at the water; freed from the usual demands of travel, he could relax and write songs. His road manager, Earl Sims (known as Speedo), said he was the only witness the day Redding picked up his guitar and wrote a new song that began \\\"Sittin' in the morning sun/I'll be sittin' when the evening comes.\\\" Mr. Sims was used to tapping out a simple beat when his boss was writing songs, acting as a human metronome. The rhythm of this new one was totally different, he said in an interview. \\\"It took me a minute to get into what he was doing. He was away, and he was on the water, and he was relaxed. That's why he started that song.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Redding returned home, he played the song for his wife. \\\"My comment at the time was that it was very different, unusual for him,\\\" she said -- meaning she didn't care for it. \\\"He said, 'Well, I'm going to change my style, going to be different.'\\\" That October, Redding had surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords; while recuperating, he couldn't speak, so he grew a beard and spent hours in silent contemplation. Five weeks later, his voice sounded better than ever, and he was eager to get some of his new ideas on wax. Steve Cropper, who regularly backed Redding up as the guitarist for Booker T. and the MG's (a.k.a. the Stax house band), remembered Redding calling him from the Memphis airport to make sure he was at the studio. When Redding arrived, the pair sat on beige folding chairs, hammering out the song. \\\"I helped him with the second verse a little bit, helped him with the bridge,\\\" Mr. Cropper said in a phone interview. \\\"After he sang, 'I watch the ships roll in, watch them roll out again,' I said, 'Have you thought that if a ship rolls, it's going to take on water and sink?'\\\" Redding told him, \\\"That's the way I want it, Crop.\\\" The duo went into the studio in November, joined by Donald Dunn (known as Duck) on bass, Al Jackson on drums, Booker T. Jones on piano and three horn players. In an interview, Mr. Jones remembered the sessions as having \\\"kind of a hectic feeling -- so much so that I remember a number of people sleeping over at the studio.\\\" Redding and Mr. Cropper planned to ask the Staple Singers to contribute backing vocals to \\\"Dock of the Bay,\\\" which never happened. The whistling at the song's end came in a section earmarked for vocal ad-libbing; on one early take, Redding sputtered and the engineer Ron Capone told him, \\\"You're not going to make it as a whistler.\\\" In the middle of the sessions, Redding went back on the road. \\\"I'll see you on Monday,\\\" were his last words to Mr. Cropper. He had recently acquired a Beechcraft Model 18 airplane so he and his touring band, the Bar-Kays, could fly around the country to play shows on weekends, letting him regularly return to Memphis. But on Dec. 10, 1967, as he flew into Madison, Wis., the plane stalled and crashed into Lake Monona, killing seven people, including Redding. It fell to a shattered Mr. Cropper to finish \\\"Dock of the Bay\\\" for a rush release. \\\"If I had a week to work on it, it probably would have been overembellished,\\\" he said. (He finished the job in 24 hours.) Different lines of the song resonate with those who have covered it over the years. Michael Bolton recorded the second-most-successful version of the track (a No. 11 hit in 1988). In an email, he said he thinks the song's key lyric is \\\"look like nothing's gonna change, everything remains the same.\\\" \\\"It states the obvious lack of our evolution as a society,\\\" he wrote. Mr. Jones agreed that line has a special power. \\\"It's one of those lyrics that has the capability of touching anyone who's been through changes, loneliness, trying to find a secure place in the world,\\\" he said. Over the past 50 years, that's proved to be just about everyone.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

Of course, this year is very different, and when I talked to pediatric emergency room specialists around the country, they reinforced summer safety advice, while noting some of the special twists and dangers of this dangerous and twisty time. \\\"Everyone has cabin fever, and they want to get out and have a good time,\\\" said Dr. Mark Zonfrillo, an associate professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. And even as many parents may feel that it's all they can do to enforce social distancing and mask-wearing, it's important to remember the safety measures from the before times as well. Dr. Maya Haasz, an attending physician in the pediatric emergency room at Children's Hospital Colorado and an assistant professor at University of Colorado School of Medicine, said they are seeing injuries that reflect a summer of individual activity rather than team sports. Kids are out riding their bikes and their scooters, she said, but not always wearing helmets. \\\"We're seeing more significant head injuries,\\\" she said.\\n\\n[Sign up for the Well Family newsletter] And because some parents are still scared to go to hospitals, injured children are sometimes not coming in immediately. The delay can be painful for the child and problematic for the doctors, for example if a laceration is more than a day old, and can't be safely sewn up. \\\"We're doing a tremendous amount to keep the hospital safe,\\\" Dr. Haasz said. \\\"You are not at risk of getting Covid in the hospital.\\\" But to help keep kids out of the emergency room, remember the sunscreen and the bike helmets and the adult supervision for kids in the water. Drowning is the leading cause of death for children from 1 to 4 and it can happen silently and swiftly, leaving behind devastated families and regrets that never go away. Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, a pediatric emergency physician and assistant professor at Emory in Atlanta, said that in 2018, 443 children from 1 to 4 died from drowning, and that it kills about 1,000 children of all ages every year. There are two peaks in age, she said, first the toddlers and young children who accidentally gain access to a body of water, and then the adolescents, the risk-takers, \\\"who might be horsing around, sneaking into pools.\\\"\\n\\nWith the pandemic, children may not be going to community pools, where there would be lifeguards, and the home pool market has been booming. \\\"A lot of people are getting new pools and first-time pools, so with that comes a responsibility for not only proper barriers and pool gates, but also proper supervision in an era of distraction,\\\" Dr. Zonfrillo said. Parents need to think about layers of safety, Dr. Agarwal said, such as having a four-foot tall fence around the entire pool, but also alarms. Parental supervision is key. \\\"We recommend for younger children and not experienced swimmers that they should always be within arm's reach,\\\" Dr. Agarwal said. Parents should not assume they can rely on a lifeguard, who will have many swimmers to watch. Even kiddie pools and shallow bodies of water can be dangerous, Dr. Zonfrillo said: \\\"A toddler can drown in just a few inches of water.\\\" If you have a trampoline, supervise children carefully, follow all safety instructions, and make sure there is only one child on the trampoline at a time. Trampoline sales have gone up in the pandemic, and doctors have been very concerned about trampoline-related fractures and trips to the emergency room. \\\"A bunch of kids on a trampoline can really cause a lot of injury,\\\" Dr. Agarwal said. Be mindful of bike safety, be vigilant about helmets. And remember that kids can get badly injured on scooters and on all-terrain vehicles, or ATVs. ATVs are very common, especially in rural communities, Dr. Agarwal said, and nationally, about four children are seen in an emergency department every hour with ATV injuries. She recently treated a child who had taken \\\"every single precaution,\\\" she said. \\\"He was on a designated ATV recreational area, he had a helmet, he was supervised, he had no passengers -- and yet he still managed to roll over his ATV on himself.\\\" Bottom line: Although she understands their appeal, Dr. Agarwal said, \\\"Don't put your kid on an ATV.\\\" Take the summer sun seriously: Keep children in the shade as much as possible, use hats and protective clothing in addition to sunscreen. Apply lots of sunscreen, reapply it every couple of hours, and after children go in the water. Make sure children stay hydrated, especially if they're exercising. Children who are engaged in athletics should start hydrating before they go out to practice, Dr. Agarwal said, and if they haven't been practicing during the shutdown, they should ease back in, and be particularly careful about hydration and heat exposure when they go back to practicing. Heat stroke is always a worry, especially vehicular heat stroke, which happens when small children are left in cars. Many doctors were worried that the pandemic might put children at additional risk, if parents who are reluctant to take them into stores leave them in vehicles. \\\"In hot temperatures, the temperature in the car can rise within minutes,\\\" Dr. Zonfrillo said. Ideally, parents should leave children at home while they do errands.\\n\\nThis year, Dr. Agarwal said, the numbers are actually looking a little better. For the past two years, over 50 children a year have died from heat stroke; there have been 11 deaths so far this year. Be aware of the danger posed by firearms that are not properly secured and stored. Firearms are not specifically a summer risk, but this is a summer of children not going to camp, and home injuries loom large. Firearm sales have increased in the pandemic, and Dr. Agarwal says that pediatric emergency doctors are worrying over these new owners especially, and whether they are storing the guns safely -- they should be stored unloaded, locked up in a gun safe or with a trigger lock, and with the ammunition locked up in a separate location. \\\"I want to encourage all parents to ask about the presence of unsecured firearms in any home where children go to visit,\\\" Dr. Agarwal said. Other at-home injuries to avoid in an at-home summer include poisonings and falls, especially falls from windows. A window screen alone is not a sufficient protection. Be aware that even the substances you're using to protect your children can be toxic; the pandemic has meant increased poisoning incidents involving hand sanitizers. Dr. Zonfrillo emphasized the importance of what he called \\\"re-child-proofing the home, based on the child's developmental age.\\\" Social isolation may be taking a toll, especially on children who suffer from anxiety or depression, and on those who may not have been able to get help and therapy virtually. On the other hand, as children begin to interact more, whether in person or virtually, and even start school again, doctors worry about bullying. Dr. Haasz said this is a time for \\\"really keeping an eye out for friends and family who have mental health concerns.\\\" To help keep vulnerable children safe, it's again important to be sure the home is injury-proofed, she said: \\\"Lock up anything they could use to hurt themselves, even seemingly benign medications like Tylenol and Benadryl.\\\" And if you're worried about your child's mental health, she said, bring it up. \\\"You are not going to harm your child by asking them questions,\\\" she said. \\\"If you are concerned about them, talk to them. If you're concerned they're going to hurt themselves, bring them into the hospital.\\\" Dr. Perri Klass is the author of the forthcoming book \\\"A Good Time to Be Born: How Science and Public Health Gave Children a Future,\\\" on how our world has been transformed by the radical decline of infant and child mortality.\",\n          \"Racism, revenge and a cross-cultural romance compete for screen time in Paul Ireland's \\\"Measure for Measure,\\\" a dolorous reimagining of Shakespeare's play set in and around a tower block in Melbourne, Australia.\\n\\nReplacing the comedy of the original with grime and violence, the movie opens with a mass shooting as a meth-addled Afghanistan veteran mows down a group of innocent, multiracial residents. This initial brutality matters less than its reverberations among the various lowlifes who share the block, most importantly the crime lord Duke (Hugo Weaving, placid and patriarchal), an old-school villain with a moral code to match.\",\n          \"Otis Redding's \\\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\\\" became a hit after his 1967 death. This week in New York, it will be celebrated at the Apollo.\\n\\nA posthumous pop hit collapses triumph and sorrow into a single song. Only a handful of performers have reached No. 1 with a single after their deaths, including John Lennon, Janis Joplin and the Notorious B.I.G. But the first person to do it was the soul singer Otis Redding, who died in a plane crash in late 1967 at 26 and topped the charts for four weeks the following March and April with a beautifully melancholy song, \\\"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay.\\\" The song ranked as the sixth-most-played composition on American radio and television in the 20th century. It has gone triple platinum and been covered by artists from Cher to Bob Dylan. Rolling Stone named it No. 26 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. To celebrate its endurance across 50 years, the Otis Redding Foundation is organizing a benefit concert on Thursday at the Apollo Theater, hosted by Whoopi Goldberg and featuring a lineup including Warren Haynes, Aloe Blacc and Booker T. Jones. The Dap-Kings and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band will provide the backup. Paul Janeway of St. Paul and the Broken Bones is scheduled to perform \\\"Down in the Valley\\\" and \\\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\\" at the event. He said that before his band had any original material, it performed complete albums by Redding. The lesson: \\\"As a singer, range is great, but you got to learn to sing the right notes the right way. Otis was one of the masters of that -- he was so emotive.\\\" And the reason behind the success of \\\"Dock of the Bay\\\"? \\\"It sounds like the title,\\\" Mr. Janeway said.\\n\\nGrace Slick, the lead singer of Jefferson Airplane, saw him at the Fillmore West in San Francisco in 1966. \\\"It was the most stunning performance I had seen up to that point,\\\" she said in a phone interview from Malibu. She remembered the stage swaying as he moved around it: \\\"I'd never seen anybody with that much positive thrust, for lack of a better term.\\\" The next summer, Redding delivered a barnburner set at the Monterey Pop Festival. \\\"This was the 'love crowd,'\\\" the record producer and Monterey organizer Lou Adler said in a phone interview. \\\"He was aware of what he was getting into but had no idea of what the response would be. As much as the performer gave at Monterey, the audience gave it right back.\\\" Zelma Redding, the singer's widow, said that after her husband had flown from the festival to their ranch in Macon, Ga., he told her, \\\"I got a new audience.\\\"\\n\\nRedding threw himself into the project of reinventing himself. \\\"It was clear that his bread and butter, which was these big 12/8 ballads, had plateaued,\\\" Jonathan Gould, the author of the recent biography \\\"Otis Redding: An Unfinished Life,\\\" said in an interview. \\\"He had done what he could do with them, which was more than anybody else could do.\\\" Like most of the world, Redding spent the summer of 1967 listening to the Beatles' \\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\\" \\\"He thought it was the greatest thing he ever heard,\\\" Ms. Redding said, speaking from her office in Georgia. \\\"I guess he was thinking about 'How can I be this creative?'\\\" In August 1967, Redding returned to San Francisco for a week of shows at the jazz club Basin Street West. When he was besieged by female fans at his hotel, the promoter Bill Graham let him stay at his houseboat in Sausalito. Redding spent his days quietly looking at the water; freed from the usual demands of travel, he could relax and write songs. His road manager, Earl Sims (known as Speedo), said he was the only witness the day Redding picked up his guitar and wrote a new song that began \\\"Sittin' in the morning sun/I'll be sittin' when the evening comes.\\\" Mr. Sims was used to tapping out a simple beat when his boss was writing songs, acting as a human metronome. The rhythm of this new one was totally different, he said in an interview. \\\"It took me a minute to get into what he was doing. He was away, and he was on the water, and he was relaxed. That's why he started that song.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Redding returned home, he played the song for his wife. \\\"My comment at the time was that it was very different, unusual for him,\\\" she said -- meaning she didn't care for it. \\\"He said, 'Well, I'm going to change my style, going to be different.'\\\" That October, Redding had surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords; while recuperating, he couldn't speak, so he grew a beard and spent hours in silent contemplation. Five weeks later, his voice sounded better than ever, and he was eager to get some of his new ideas on wax. Steve Cropper, who regularly backed Redding up as the guitarist for Booker T. and the MG's (a.k.a. the Stax house band), remembered Redding calling him from the Memphis airport to make sure he was at the studio. When Redding arrived, the pair sat on beige folding chairs, hammering out the song. \\\"I helped him with the second verse a little bit, helped him with the bridge,\\\" Mr. Cropper said in a phone interview. \\\"After he sang, 'I watch the ships roll in, watch them roll out again,' I said, 'Have you thought that if a ship rolls, it's going to take on water and sink?'\\\" Redding told him, \\\"That's the way I want it, Crop.\\\" The duo went into the studio in November, joined by Donald Dunn (known as Duck) on bass, Al Jackson on drums, Booker T. Jones on piano and three horn players. In an interview, Mr. Jones remembered the sessions as having \\\"kind of a hectic feeling -- so much so that I remember a number of people sleeping over at the studio.\\\" Redding and Mr. Cropper planned to ask the Staple Singers to contribute backing vocals to \\\"Dock of the Bay,\\\" which never happened. The whistling at the song's end came in a section earmarked for vocal ad-libbing; on one early take, Redding sputtered and the engineer Ron Capone told him, \\\"You're not going to make it as a whistler.\\\" In the middle of the sessions, Redding went back on the road. \\\"I'll see you on Monday,\\\" were his last words to Mr. Cropper. He had recently acquired a Beechcraft Model 18 airplane so he and his touring band, the Bar-Kays, could fly around the country to play shows on weekends, letting him regularly return to Memphis. But on Dec. 10, 1967, as he flew into Madison, Wis., the plane stalled and crashed into Lake Monona, killing seven people, including Redding. It fell to a shattered Mr. Cropper to finish \\\"Dock of the Bay\\\" for a rush release. \\\"If I had a week to work on it, it probably would have been overembellished,\\\" he said. (He finished the job in 24 hours.) Different lines of the song resonate with those who have covered it over the years. Michael Bolton recorded the second-most-successful version of the track (a No. 11 hit in 1988). In an email, he said he thinks the song's key lyric is \\\"look like nothing's gonna change, everything remains the same.\\\" \\\"It states the obvious lack of our evolution as a society,\\\" he wrote. Mr. Jones agreed that line has a special power. \\\"It's one of those lyrics that has the capability of touching anyone who's been through changes, loneliness, trying to find a secure place in the world,\\\" he said. Over the past 50 years, that's proved to be just about everyone.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n
